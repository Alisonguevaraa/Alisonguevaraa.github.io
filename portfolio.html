        <h3>Description of the Game</h3>
        <p>The story of the game is basically playing old pong but with different<br>
        sprites. This is a two player game where both sprites can move up, down, left,<br>
        and right to fight with the opposite player over the point. The type of<br>
        scoring that my partner and I implement was varable. The use of randomness<br>
        occurs when the ball sprite hits the sprites in order to continue the game.<br>
        The game gets more difficult once the two players start getting aggresive with<br>
        their sprite and try to get the point. The game ends once a player reaches<br>
        10 points and then it will restart.</p>
